      <div id="aboutus">

	    <p>Let us introduce ourselves to you. Our friendly staff were close friends for many years, sharing one of our common interests, our love for dogs.  While at one of our 'girls' gathering, we came up with this fantastic idea of a grooming salon for dogs.  We all worked well and hard together and share a common goal, the goal of keeping our passion alive and keeping our customers and pooches happy.  We look forward to meeting you.</p>

	    <h3> Ms. Sue Sandy (Owner)</h3>
	    <img src="Images/paw-picture.png" align = "left" width="55" height="35" >
	    <p>I am the Founder and Owner of Sandy's Pet Shop. I obtained my Animal Husbandry Doctorate degree at the University of California, Davis in 1993.  Worked my way up from a Kennel Technician, to Director of the Guide Dogs, and owned a Veterinary Medicine practice. My love of animals sparked this caring facility for all animals to be looking their best so they could be hugged and enjoyed by their human companion. My motto is to treat my clients (the animals) with gentleness, no stress, and be pampered because while they are here, they are our most important "friends" at the spa and will receive special treatment.</p>

	    <img src="Images/paw-picture.png" align = "left" width="55" height="35" >
	    <p>Having groomed for 30 years, I know that this is indeed, my passion.  I received a scholarship to the Colorado School of Dog Grooming in 1984 and have previously worked for others and also owned my own salon in Sacramento.  I am happy to call Novato my home and enjoy getting to know my fellow dog lovers in the North Bay!.</p>
